## Chapter 11 - Lab - Working with Pygame


### [Assignment Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFLQs7Lepb8hcYOrZq5scmRmdcNkIwWZ6Kb85_0bCVY/edit?usp=sharing)

Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols._

## SUMMARY:
The first step, Part A, involved the movement of the enemies approaching the hero. They moved either 1, 0 or -1 for each of their movements until they reached, therefore ending the game. 

#### Unique Feature
The unique feature I intended to add was a random draw of a game map setting. Considering a huge part of the success of video games lies in the visual aid and setting created, I thought the blank background would be a boring scene for the showdown between the hero and enemies. I loaded the images in separate files with the assets tab (background 1-3). Then, under the src tab, I created a file titled background.py. Ideally, when the program ran, it would have randomized which of the three battle arenas the characters fought in. While this portion of the lab does not completely work, I think some of the code written under background.py is correct.

## GRACE DAYS

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
The background images do not load onto the screen when the program runs.

This was the python sprite library embedded with the lab that I used. 

Additionally, I used the python library and description provided.
